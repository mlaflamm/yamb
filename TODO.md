## Quick and dirty TODO list:
* Select a license.
* Ant or maven build. 
* Documentation.
* Release YAMB as a binary package. Verify license of all libraries. I suspect that many cannot be distributed with YAMB. 
- Split the video thumbnail code in separate modules, one per external library. This would not requires all the external libraries to build and run YAMB. 
* Configuration
* Try Xuggle for thumbnail generation.
